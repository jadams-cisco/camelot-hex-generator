Hello there! 

This reposity contains a simple python script to preform the hex counting needed to setup camelot. The script is currently funcitonal, however it has a LOT of work needed yet. When time allows I will finish the script properly and publish a finished version. 

I am a new devloper so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! 

Thanks!
Jacob
